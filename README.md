# ORBD
Open Refreshable Braille Display - Science Fair Project by Adam Walker &amp; Russell Ro

This project uses motors in order to spin wheels that display a variety of braille characters quickly at less than 1% of the cost of present braille displays on the market.

Abstract:

285 million people are estimated to be visually impaired worldwide. Many of these individuals do not have access to blind-assistive technology primarily due to cost and accessibility. One such device, the refreshable braille display, converts digital text to a tactile readout providing a valuable tool in reading and writing applications. However, prices range from $3,500 to $15,000 making it difficult for many low-income visually impaired individuals to buy a device, especially since non-institutionalized persons aged 21-64 years with a visual disability have a median annual household income of $39,700 and about 29% of them live below the poverty line. Since many refreshable braille displays are prohibitively expensive, previous approaches have attempted to lower its cost by restricting the number of characters displayed, but this arose the new problem of higher translation error rates. In order to make refreshable braille displays more effective for a greater number of visually impaired individuals, our open-source device, ORBD, will provide a cheaper alternative to existing braille displays that does not sacrifice on readability, including the number of characters. ORBD is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller that takes digital input through a computer and translates those characters to a stepper motor position. An octagonal tactile surface connected to the motor via gear train displays the characters accordingly. Depending on user preference, more characters may be added by attaching extra gears and stepper motors. By accounting for accessibility through it being open-source, users have access to assembling their own refreshable braille display with parts that amount to a fraction of other devicesâ€™ prices.

This project competed at the Beal Bank USA Southern Nevada Regional Science & Engineering Fair at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas on March 14, 2018.
